;- V-LIST Polymorphic Vertical List
;
;  Build a vertival list of sub-faces.
;  Sub-faces are defined by a user style and may have varying sizes.
;  This style is optimized so that it can manage huge lists with a small footprint.
;  Only the visible sub-faces are actually showed.
;  The REBOL's graphic engine will go faster and it also saves memory.
;  Hidden sub-faces are kept in a small cache so that,
;   sub-faces which play the 'hide and seek' game a lot
;   are simply stacked/unstacked (without the need to reconstruct them each time).
;  Another optimization is related to the recycling of the sub-faces not needed anymore.
;  These are not destroyed but go in a pool instead.
;  When a new sub-face must be created, a free one is taken from the pool.
;  This way, the creation of sub-faces is faster and memory safer (no endless recycling).
;
;  INPUT:
;	child-style [block!]: the user style of the sub-faces (optionnal)
;	data [block!]:	data container from which the sub-faces pick their content (optionnal)
;
;  A legit user's child-style must contain a RESIZE action which is called
;  by V-LIST to refresh the content of any sub-face when required.
;  The face/data of a sub-face must be used to reflect the content modification.
;  The resize action must also contain code which refresh the size of the sub-face,
;   even if the size does not vary.
;  For instance:
;  ... resize [
;				;(V-LIST automaticly reset face/text and face/size)
;				text mold face/data/pick 1	; reflect any modification of the data content
;				size 100x20					; size must also be refreshed.
;      ]
;
;  USAGE:
;    has [data: [...] child-style: [...] is v-list]
;    has [data: [...] child-style: [...] goto: length? data  is v-list] ; start showing the tail
;
;  TO-DO: To be able to build H-LIST from it (all the /y become /x)
