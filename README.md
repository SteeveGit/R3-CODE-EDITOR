R3-CODE-EDITOR
==============

Code editor for R3 built with R3

For now, only the vertical scrolling is worth to be tested.
Random crashes are still to be feared.

Tested with R3 on Windows 7.
You will need the Saphirion's Rebol3 version, 
which can be found at http://www.saphirion.com/development/downloads-2/

Then, just do %code-editor.r3


Warning: For Rebolers who transcode/error little English only.
